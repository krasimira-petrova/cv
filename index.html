            <h2>Short History</h2>
            <p>Hello to everyone! My name is Krasimira Petrova and I want to work as a front-end developer. I have studied
                law but after spending a couple of years in the field I have decided to take a new challenge.
                I am going into the depths of programming as I have always dreamed for.
                I am studying software development now and I am very exited to find my dream job!</p>
