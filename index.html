            <h2>Short History</h2>
            <p>Hello to everyone! My name is Krasimira Petrova and I want to work as a front-end developer.
                I have studied law but after spending a couple of years in the field I have decided to take a new
                challenge.
                I am going into the depths of programming as I have always dreamed for. I am studying software
                development now and
                I am very exited to find my dream job!</p>
            <p>My journey in programming began in october 2018 when I visited the study group of Rails Girls Sofia.
                There I began to learn HyperText Markup Language and after that I continued with Cascading Style Sheet.
                I was participant in Rails Girls Sofia 11 in november 2018 and after four months I was a part of
                instructors team in the following Rails Girls Sofia event.
                Meantime I started to attend Software University where I am studying JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I am continuing to be part of Rails Girls Sofia volunteer instructors team and keep up with my education.
                I am looking for front-end job opportunities and I hope to find my place soon!
            </p>
